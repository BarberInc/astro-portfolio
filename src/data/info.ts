  about: `I'm a freelance software engineer based in LA/Monterey, California. I moved here from Florida not too long ago, and have been looking for a new place/communnity to be a part of.
   I enjoy learning about most everything, with a higher interest in things that involve the human brain/nerve system especially as related to artificial intelligence when it comes to computer systems.  
   I have been looking for work in the LA/Sanfrancisco/Monterey CA area, and have been getting by doing smaller jobs like door dash and reselling things of vantity.
   I have some years of experience in lower level programming languages and have recently gotten into utilizing ChatGPT, although I have been looking for an opportunity to obtain access to and to make use of Google's bard AI tool.
   I have a fair amount of experience, much more than the average computer user, using a number of different operating systems, some of which include: Windows 7(most when it comes to windows), ~8~, 10, linux kernel based OS's including debian systems (kali, parrot OS, Qubes, debian 10, Ubuntu...), ArchLinux (garuda, BlackArch, Manjaro, plain arch...(my personal favorite and what I use on my personal machine)),
   Some expereience with CentOS 8 albiet not much, have used it to set up servers on GCP...
   I am completely self taught through personal experience and self interest in the majority of things I know, especially relating to biological systems and programming.
   I learned a lot of my programming knowledge through an interest in reverse engineering and making mods for video games when I was younger, that was what really got my interested in programming and taking things apart to see how they worked.
   I spend my free time investing in my self, meaning learning new skills and reading about things I find interesting - music, languages, medicine, quantum computing, AI research to name a few things.
   I only have a High School education, albiet I did spend a a year or so in a state college attempting to get a degree in applied physics but found that I rather quickly lost interest in the courses that did not have a direct coincision with the things I wanted to learn.
   I have a decent amount of knowledgeability in a few languages, (reading/writing, not so much with speaking besides the first three), some of which include - 
    - Chinese
    - Japanese
    - German
    - A small amount of Swedish, Russian, French, and Latin, ordered in from left to right based on my level of comprehension
